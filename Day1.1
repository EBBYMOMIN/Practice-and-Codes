Write a simple program to determine if a given year is a leap year using user input.
Note: 
1) Leap year occurs once every four years.
2) A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not if it is divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
==============================================================================================================================================================

year = int(input("Enter the year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is a normal year")

LOGIN AUTHENTICATION: using conditional statement. Assume you have predetermined username and password.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a username and password and checks whether they match. Provide appropriate messages for the following cases:
1) Both username and password are correct.
2) Username is correct but password is incorrect.
3) Username is incorrect.
==============================================================================================================================================================

#predefined user name and password
predefined_username = "EBADARMANM"
predefined_password = "1993"

#prompt the user to enter a username and password.
username = input("Please enter your Username: ")
password = input("Please enter your Password: ")

# user name and password match
if username == predefined_username:
    if password == predefined_password:
        print("Welcome! Login was successful.")
    else:
        print("Incorrect Password.")
else:
    print("Invalid Username.")

ADMISSION ELIGIBILITY: A university has the following eligibility criteria for admission:

1) Marks in Mathematics >= 65
2) Marks in Physics >= 55
3) Marks in Chemistry >= 50
4) Total marks in all three subjects >= 180 OR Total marks in mathematics and Physics >= 140

Write a program that takes marks in three subjects as input and prints whether the student is eligible for addmission.
================================================================================================================================================================

#taking input from user
print("Enter PCM marks out of 100.")
maths_marks = int(input("Enter marks obtained in Maths: "))
physics_marks = int(input("Enter marks obtained in Physics: "))
chemistry_marks = int(input("Enter marks obtained in Chemistry: "))
total_marks = maths_marks + physics_marks + chemistry_marks
total_maths_physics = maths_marks + physics_marks

#printing outputs form user
print("Maths Marks:", maths_marks)
print("Physics Marks:", physics_marks)
print("Chemistry Marks:", chemistry_marks)
print("Total Marks:", total_marks)
print("Physics and Maths Total Marks:", total_maths_physics)

# Eligibility checks
if maths_marks >= 65 and physics_marks >= 55 and chemistry_marks >= 50 and (total_marks >= 180 or total_maths_physics >= 140):
    print("Congratulations! You are eligible for Admission")
else:
    print("Oh Snap! You are not eligible for admission.")
